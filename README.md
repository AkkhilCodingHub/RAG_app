# RAG_app

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with LangChain that enhances Large Language Model responses with relevant context from your documents. This application combines the power of:

- **Document Processing**: Efficiently splits and processes your text documents
- **Vector Storage**: Uses Chroma DB for semantic search and retrieval
- **Embeddings**: Leverages HuggingFace's sentence-transformers for document embeddings
- **Custom LLM Integration**: Flexible integration with any LLM API endpoint
- **RAG Pipeline**: Combines document retrieval with LLM generation for accurate, context-aware responses

## Quick Start
